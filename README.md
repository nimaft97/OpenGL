# OpenGL

## SETUP
The combination that I prefer to use is Visual Studio and Windows. However, I used GLFW to create a box that is compatible with all three major OSs
- Download GLFW binaries from [here](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Copy the `include` folder and the latest `lib` folder to dependencies folder
- Link them to the project in Visual Studio (e.g., properties -> C/C++ and linker). For better robustness, use relative directories instead of abolute paths
- Download GLEW binaries from [here](https://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- Copy `include` and `lib` folder to dependencies folder
- Link them to the project in visual studio
